/* electron-builder configuration.
 *
 * Moved out of package.json so signing can be chosen by the environment rather
 * than hardcoded — the same shape NitroAI uses.
 *
 *   • Signed + notarized — set MAC_SIGN=1 with a "Developer ID Application"
 *     identity reachable in the keychain (or CSC_LINK in CI), plus
 *     APPLE_ID / APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD / APPLE_TEAM_ID. electron-builder
 *     signs with the hardened runtime, notarizes, and staples. The app then
 *     opens on the first double-click with no warning at all.
 *
 *   • Ad-hoc fallback (no cert) — identity:null, so a fork or a secret-less CI
 *     run still produces a valid (not "damaged") build. It is NOT distributable:
 *     macOS refuses it after a download, and since macOS 15 the old
 *     right-click → Open escape hatch is gone.
